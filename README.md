# Line Follower Robot

This repository contains the source code for each technical demonstration created for a university project developing an autonomous line-following robot.
The project uses the Mbed OS online compiler platform to connect to 32-bit ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.

The programs, written in C++, display various functionalities including PWM motor control, line sensing, and PID control algorithms.
